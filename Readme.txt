OPTIMIZED DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL ARCHITECTURES FOR CROSS-DOMAIN CLASSIFICATION TASKS

WORK DESCRIPTION

1. Designed and implemented custom ResNet, VGG, and Inception architectures, incorporating hybrid blocks for robust image (CIFAR-10) and audio (SpeechCommand V0.02) classification.
2. Trained high-performance models using PyTorchâ€™s torchvision and torchaudio libraries, achieving key accuracy benchmarks with Cross-Entropy loss and Adam optimization.
3. Developed a robust pipeline with custom checkpointing for efficient training, evaluation, and reproducibility across complex datasets.
4. Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Torchaudio, Torchvision, Google Colab
